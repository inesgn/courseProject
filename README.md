Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
=======================================

This repo contains Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data course project, August of 2014.

Project Goals
-------------
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with and clean a data set in R. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analyses. 

In this project, evaluation is done by peers. Therefore we are asked to submit:

* a tidy data set
* a link to this Github repo
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data in a CodeBook.md file.

About the data
--------------
The data sets used for this project contain measures collected from the accelerometers from the Samsumg Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at this site:

The data itself can be downloaded from this url

Files in this repo
------------------
In this repo you will find:

1. A **run_analysis.R** file containing the code (i.e. transformations to generate tidy data set)
2. A **TidyDataSet.txt** file containing the final tidy data set
3. A code book describing variables in this final data set
